# CoreNFC-Demo

# Requirements

* iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus
* iOS 11 Beta
* Xcode 9 Beta
* Apple Developer Account

# Getting Started

The CoreNFC framework requires an App ID with the NFC Tag Read permission set in your Apple Developer Account. So head over to https://developer.apple.com and create an App ID and Provisioning Profile with the aforementioned permission. Then select the profile in Xcode or hope that Xcode will select the right profile (didn't work out for me).
